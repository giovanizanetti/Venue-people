      This project is my version of the Venue People assignment.
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to take
      this assignment. I did my best to reproduce the mockup provided, paying
      attention to the requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      I still have quite some ideas about things I would add to improve in this
      assignment. However, as I already added some extra features, I decided to
      wrap it up from here.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      But, please! Do let me know if there is anything else I could do to
      improve this assignment. I'm very excited by the possibility of working
      for Constell, I don't want to miss this opportunity.
    </p>
